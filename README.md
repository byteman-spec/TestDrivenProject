Project Title: Custom Compiler Development using Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Project Description:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a compiler capable of compiling a custom coding language from scratch, while adhering to the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. Additionally, the project aims to enhance the developer's skills in TDD, deepen their understanding of compiler construction, and improve their knowledge of software design principles.

Key Objectives:

Language Design: Formalize the syntax and semantics of the custom coding language.
Test Suite Creation: Develop a comprehensive suite of tests covering all aspects of the compiler's functionality, including parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.
Compiler Architecture: Design the architecture of the compiler, including lexical analysis, syntax parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation stages.
Test-Driven Development: Implement the compiler functionality incrementally, starting with failing tests and then writing code to make them pass, thereby improving TDD skills.
Continuous Integration: Integrate automated testing into the development workflow to ensure the reliability and stability of the compiler at all stages.
Documentation: Maintain detailed documentation covering the design decisions, implementation details, and usage instructions for the compiler.
